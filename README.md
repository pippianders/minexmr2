### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is [minexmr2.com](https://minexmr2.com) Monero mining pool implementation based
on [jtgrassie monero-pool](https://github.com/jtgrassie/monero-pool). Thus all the build instructions are there.

Initial code commit incorporates a patch for 'last_block_found_height' json field to be readable at statistics URL https://minexmr2.com/stats
utilized by [miningpoolstats.stream](https://miningpoolstats.stream/monero).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [SChernykh p2pool](https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool) support to redirect all the mining traffic there.
But all the statistics, billing and fault-tolerant logic remains here, in this minexmr2.com pool implementation.
