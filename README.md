### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is [minexmr2.com](https://minexmr2.com) Monero mining pool implementation based
on [jtgrassie monero-pool](https://github.com/jtgrassie/monero-pool).
Note though, nearly 50% of source code in added/rewritten.
Thus all the build instructions are there.
Just instead of 'make release', 'make release_p2pool'.

- ðŸ”­ Base support of [SChernykh p2pool](https://github.com/SChernykh/p2pool) has been implemented!
Now minexmr2.com uses decentralized p2pool as a hashrate-liquidity provider.
If you mine with us, all your hashrate is contributed to p2pool, helping to empower decentralization.
But all the statistics, billing and fault-tolerant logic remains in minexmr2.com. You have nothing to build, deploy, upgrade and maintain
like in your own p2pool instance!

âš¡ Sep 22 2022: [minexmr2.com](https://minexmr2.com) status online and fully operational; blocks are being found by local
p2pool instance, approx. 1.62 blocks/hour. Detailed info at [minexmr2.com](https://minexmr2.com).
